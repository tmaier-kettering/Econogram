# Econogram

Econogram is a desktop application for creating and analyzing cash flow diagrams used in engineering economics. It provides a visual interface for working with time value of money calculations, including present value, future value, and annual value conversions.

## What is Econogram?

Econogram helps students and educators visualize and solve engineering economics problems. The software allows you to:

- Create cash flow diagrams with multiple series
- Insert single cash flows, uniform series, gradient series, and geometric series
- Calculate present value (PV), future value (FV), and annual value (AV) of cash flows
- Combine and manipulate cash flow series
- Export results as tables for analysis
- Work with a global interest rate that applies to all calculations

## Download

No installation required - simply download and run the .exe file.

## Example
